# Fisher's Geometric Model for Partially Selfing Populations

## Overview

This is the GitHub repository for the development of a theoretical population genetics project aimed at using Fisher's Geometric Model of adaptation to derive the distribution of different mutation classes and the probability of different outcomes of selection in populations with partial self-fertilization. Citing information for the resulting paper will be provided when it is made [available through the publisher](http://XXXXX). You can also contact me directly if you would like a reprint. Here you can find all of the necessary code to reproduce the analyses and the pre-publication manuscript. The *Mathematica* `.nb` files where the models are developed are not tracked by git, but can be downloaded as an online appendix from the publisher website above (or contact me and I will be happy to provide if you don't have access to the appendices). Aside from the `.nb` files, all necessary code for creating the figures can be found in the `./R/functions-*.R` files. 


## Citing information

Will be come available when the manuscript has successfully passed the peer review process


## Reproducing the manuscript

The easiest way to reproduce the manuscript is to simply clone the repo, run `createFigs.R`, and then compile the manuscript file `doc/....tex` using whatever default LaTeX editor/engine you have. 


## Contact & bug reporting

Please report any bugs, problems, or issues by opening an issue on the FGM-PartSelf github [issues page](https://github.com/colin-olito/FGM-PartSelf/issues). If you would like to report a bug/issue, and do not have a github account (and don't want to get one), please send a brief email detailing the problem you encountered to colin.olito at monash dot edu.
